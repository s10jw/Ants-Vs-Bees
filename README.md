# Ants-Vs-Bees
 This project was the culmination of my Object-Oriented Programming CS class at Cal. It is a 2D game much like the classic Plants Vs. Zombies, except now using insects! This project had me mainly working in ants.py, where I implemented all of my OOP techniques learned over the semester.
