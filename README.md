# Ants-Vs-Bees
This project was the culmination of my Object-Oriented Programming CS class at UC Berkeley. It is a 2D game much like the classic Plants Vs. Zombies, except now using insects! This project had me mainly working in **ants.py**, where I implemented all of my OOP techniques learned over the semester.

Ants Vs. Bees, much like the original game it's modeled after, is a tower defense game, where you the player have to strategically defend the board using all resources available. Food is used as a currency to purchase and place new ants, of which there are numerous different types, all with different abilities. The player uses these ants to attempt to stop the aggressors, the bees, from marching all the way accross the board.

In this project, I focused on creating the class structure that ties all of these ants and bees together. Beginning with foundational classes such as Insect, I define cascading class attributes and methods, which will later be inherited by more specialized ants and bees, like the Fire Ant, and Wasp.

Overall, this project focused heavily on abstraction and class inheritance. Abstraction is displayed in this project through the breaking down of all objects in this game into their respective fundamental pieces, subsequently using those pieces to build more complicated objects through inheritance. It was a lot of fun at the time, and definitely helped me gain a better grasp on proper approaches towards building object-oriented applications in the future.

# How to Play
In order to play, run gui.py found in the main directory. Place harvester ants in the beginning to gain more food, and use that food to begin building your strategic ant army. The game is lost when bees cross the board, and is won when all bees are defeated.

# Contributions
Many thanks to the CS department at UC Berkeley for providing the backend work and vision required to make this game a success.
